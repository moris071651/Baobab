This website serves as a front-end interface for GitHub APIs. It searches for results within the science topic and presents all the relevant information right in front of you.
It is licensed under GPL3, and you are free to use it as you see fit. Feel free to experiment with it, modify it, or even push its boundaries in any way you desire.
I should also mention that this project is part of NASA Space Apps Challenge 2023 Sofia, and I would be happy if I don't see it again.

# ABOUT THE CHALLENGE
There are many different open science and open-source projects and tools, but no efficient way to match project creators with interested collaborators who possess the skills required to contribute. Your challenge is to create a solution that will help people who are looking for open-source projects to work on and project creators who need skilled contributors to find each other and communicate.
