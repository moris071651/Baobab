        Hello, everyone!
        <br><br>
        I hope you're all doing well and taking good care of yourselves. Today, I'd like to introduce you to my project.
        <br><br>
        Before we dive into the project itself, I'd like to explain why it exists and why it may not be as polished as I'd like it to be. You see, I was encouraged by my economics teacher to participate in the hackathon, even though my primary interest lies in Linux and operating systems.
        <br><br>
        While web development isn't my main passion, I've embraced the challenge and created this project. So, without further delay, let me present it to you.
        <br><br>
        The challenge I undertook was to create a website that facilitates connections between open science projects and potential contributors, and I (kinda poorly) achieved that goal.
        <br><br>
        This website serves as a front-end interface for GitHub APIs. It searches for results within the science topic and presents all the relevant information right in front of you.
        <br><br>
        In conclusion, I would advise against using or further developing this project, as it is not intended for practical use. Instead, I encourage you to explore more robust and purpose-built solutions for your needs, like GITHUB.
        I look forward to exploring new horizons and contributing to projects that align more closely with my passions and interests.
        <br><br>
        Thank you for your time and consideration.
        <br><br>
        Best regards, Moris071651
